        <h1>Drew Peppley</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Drew, and I'm a GIMM student if that wasn't obvious already. I have done some moderate web development in the past, so I am familiar with HTML, CSS and JS, though I'm (mostly) too lazy to use the latter two for the moment. I have done very little with databases and backend integration.</p>
        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <table style="width:70%">
            <tr>
                <td style="width:40%">
                    <img src="images/paji.png" alt="Paji" width="100%">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>I've been volunteering at the Boise Zoo every summer for seven years, and to accompany this here is a picture of Paji the sloth bear playing with a piece of wood she found. The picture is admittedly blurry since her window is so dirty from her putting her mouth on the glass so much.</p>

                    <p>Recently I started getting into miniature painting, here's a few of my favorites from the miniature wargame Star Wars Legion. For the purposes of adding a hyperlink, here's <a href="https://tabletopadmiral.com/viewlist/153534">the list</a> of my full Rebel Alliance army.</p>
                </td>

                    <p>My board game collection is larger than it probably should be, but I'm proud of it. For consistency's sake I need an image so here's the absolute chaotic mess of one of my favorite board games, Twilight Imperium, a 4X style space opera strategy game, or what I like to call "Risk but if it was actually fun".</p>

        <h2>Cool Places</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If it wasn't obvious already, I love the Boise Zoo, granted I'm rather biased toward it since I've been volunteering there for so long.</li>
            <li>My family and I are big campers, so by extension I'm a fan of the Idaho outdoors. I admit this is incredibly broad, but one place we always come back to is Silver Creek, up near Cascade.</li>
            <li>The GIMM Lab (No I wasn't paid to say this, I definitely couldn't think of anything else and someone is DEFINITELY NOT holding a gun to my head right now and this is NOT a cry for help and if you have your phone on you at the moment you definitely do not under any circumstance need to call the police). :)</li>
