                            <p>Guild Wars 2 is my favorite video game, a free-to-play fantasy MMORPG developed by ArenaNet. The game diverts from many of the trends set by modern MMO giants, including the lack of a subscription model and strict vertical progression, and it doesn't invalidate older content with each new release. The game also sports one of the strongest mount systems in any MMO I have played, with each different mount having a unique traversal mechanic.</p>
                            <p>I found the game when I was simply looking for a new game in the MMO genre to try, since I didn't have the money to pay a subscription fee. That was over four years ago and I'm still here to celebrate the game's tenth anniversary, which was just last month, and the game is still going strong.</p>

                            <p>The Stormlight Archive is my favorite book series, an epic fantasy series written by bestselling author Brandon Sanderson. While the story is far too large and complex to concisely explain (each book is over 1000 pages), I'll explain it as such: it follows the story of a set of various individuals who refound a long since disbanded order known as the Knights Radiant, in order to defend the world from a coming desolation.</p>

                            <p>I don't know specifically what brought me to find the book (I kind of just... did), but what got me stuck reading the whole series (so far) is the incredibly unique worldbuilding and magic system, as well as the author's ability to create massive, epic stories while still being focused heavily on it's characters, the most important part of the series.</p>

                            <p>Two Steps From Hell is a music production company focusing on orchestral music, and among them is Thomas Bergersen, my favorite artist. His music is all over the place, heard most often in trailers and documentaries (and I've even heard some of his older stuff played during football games at BSU). Basically, lots of people have heard his music but few actually know of him.</p>
                            <p>I found Thomas's music while I was looking for good music to play during D&D games, and while I initially latched on to the epic style of his music, I grew to love some of his newer, more experimental music the most.</p>
